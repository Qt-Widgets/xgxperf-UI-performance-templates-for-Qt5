 
 LiveMem QScreen driver for Qt Embedded
 ******************************************
 This Screen Driver for Qt/Embedded allows systems that do not have a 
 natively supported output interface (ex, with no FrameBuffer), to use a
 file as a screen surface. The file can be read to see the output of 
 rendering operations.

 Depends on Qt/e only. Tested on Qt4.6.x

 Current Status - "Alpha". See TODO list.

 HOW TO INTEGRATE INTO QT BUILD:
 >>cd <QTDIR>/src/plugins/gfxdrivers
 >>cp -rf <downloads>/livemem ./
 >>cp -rf <downloads>/gfxdrivers.pro ./
 >>make
 >>make install
 >>ls -l <QTDIR>/plugins/gfxdrivers/libqscreenlivemem.so

 HOW TO TEST:
 1. Create a file /opt/livemem/livemem.bin
 2. Build and install the livemem driver as specified in Integration steps
 3. Set livemem as screen driver like below, at runtime:
 >> "calculator -qws -display livemem"
 4. Stop the application and see the output in Irfanview or other editor.

 The output of all screen painting operations by Qt, goes to the file 
 LIVEMEM_DEVICE_NAME.

 This file can be opened in any image editor and viewed, setting the appropriate
 w,h, and bpp.

 Irfanview settings for viewing the default output are in 
 livemem_irfanview_setting.JPG file in this directory.

 DEFAULTS:
 Output file name - /opt/livemem/livemem.bin
 w = 480, h = 640, bpp = 16

 TODO:
 -A saner way of passing file device name,screen parameters to driver 
 than hardcoding it.
 -Add livemem to Qt config itself, than hardcoding into gfxdrivers.pro
 -Add caching support
 -Rotation not handled
 -Cursor not tested
 -Performance not tested
 -Not tested with client only applications
